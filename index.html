                        <p class="about__text">Hey there, I am a Software Engineer with 2+ years of experience in developing microservices and IVR systems using Java, Springboot, and Nice CXone. I have a proven ability to design, develop, and maintain scalable and reliable software systems using microservices architecture. I have strong problem-solving and analytical skills, with a focus on producing high-quality code and resolving technical issues related to microservices and IVR systems. I also have excellent communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work independently and as part of a team.

In my previous role at Acme Corporation, I was responsible for developing and maintaining the company's IVR system. I worked with a team of engineers to design and implement a new call routing system that improved customer satisfaction by 20%. I also developed a callback functionality that reduced average call wait time by 25%.

I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a passion for software development. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I am confident that I can make a significant contribution to your team.

When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with new technologies and experimenting with new tools to make my development workflow even smoother. I'm always up for a challenge and excited to bring your ideas to life.

So, if you're looking for a backend developer who knows their way around Java Spring Boot and microservices, drop me a line! I promise I won't throw any coffee mugs at your computer (but I can't promise I won't spill coffee on it, sorry).
